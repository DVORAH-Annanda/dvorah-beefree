          God has transmitted his very substance into every Scripture, for it is
          God-breathed. It will empower you by its instruction and correction,
          giving you the strength to take the right direction and lead you
          deeper into the path of godliness.

        <h5>Cultivate what matters (Galatians 5)</h5>
        <h6>Harvest Christian Fellowship Church - Jonathan Laurie</h6>
        <p>
          Imagine you have two seeds in your hand and you can only plant one.
          One seed grows easily, but it produces produces ugly, terrible tasting
          fruit. Cultivating the other seed takes time and consistent
          attention—but the fruit it produces is beautiful and delicious. Which
          seed would you choose to plant, water, and grow? In Galatians 5, the
          apostle Paul talks about two types of fruit our lives can produce:
          fruit of the flesh and fruit of the Spirit. “The flesh” refers to our
          desires that pull us away from God’s Holy Spirit. Those desires
          produce hate, impatience, bitterness, selfishness, rudeness, chaos,
          anxiety, and self-indulgence—and God has no association with such
          things. But when we commit our lives to Jesus, He gives us His Holy
          Spirit. The power of the Holy Spirit helps us “crucify” the desires of
          our flesh and put them to death. And when we crucify those desires, we
          create room for the Holy Spirit to produce fruit in us that leads to
          positive life change. “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
          forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and
          self-control.” Galatians 5:22-23 NIV Our flesh wants to get even, but
          the Spirit calls us to extend kindness. Our flesh wants to entertain
          sinful thoughts, but the Spirit calls us to walk in self-control. Our
          flesh wants to dictate our emotional response, but the Spirit calls us
          to walk in joy and peace. The Fruit of the Spirit reveals that we are
          actively seeking God and rejecting disobedience. So right now, reflect
          on your life. What fruit is it producing? Are you experiencing love,
          joy, peace, patience, and kindness—or are there pockets of bitterness,
          anger, jealousy, and self-indulgence in your life? What steps do you
          need to take to “crucify” beliefs and attitudes pulling you away from
          God? Let the Holy Spirit show you what you need to remove, and then
          let Him transform your attitudes, actions, and desires.
